    <h1>I am trying out the HTML roboClass on GitHub</h1>
    It's a different way of working. I can see that there is a call-and-response learning curve. It looks useful for all-hands-on-deck work.
    <h2>Is this a good way to learn both HTML and GitHub?</h2>

    <h2>How are these headers forking for a FAQ?</h2>

    <h2>How are you doing?</h2>
